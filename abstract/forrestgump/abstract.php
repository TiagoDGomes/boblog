			<p>Winston Groom, 67, is the writer of the acclaimed novel about the Vietnam War, "Better times than these". He has published eight books and was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. <em>Forest Gump - The Storyteller</em>, (adapted for film in 1994) is his fifth book.</p>
			<p>Launched in 1986, in its 196 pages, tells the story in first person from Forrest, an American man who lost his father when he was a baby and was raised by his mother. Owing to his below normal Q.I., was educated at a school for special children. He was the victim of prejudice, had only one friend, her neighbor Jenny, with whom he was in love with.</p>
			<p>As a teenager, was discovered by a soccer coach, who was  attracted by his speed to run and got him a place at the famous University of Harvard.</p>
			<p>Already in the University, surprised everyone once again with their skills in solving advanced calculus in a physics course, even failing in less complex school subjects. Forrest got another friend, Bubba, who teaches him how to play harmonica. Later they meet again in the army, and plan to enter into the business of shrimp after leaving there.</p> 
			<p>They are summoned to the Vietnam War, where they fall in an ambush, Forrest, wounded in the buttocks, bravely rescues one by one, members of his team, including Bubba, but this unfortunately does not stand up to his injuries and dies.</p>
			<p>Forrest then is considered a national hero, won a medal from the president, and when questioned about where it was shot, shows his breech on television interview, showing disdain (not intentionally) by the rules of decency and morals of the time.</p>
			<p>He learned to play Ping-Pong, is invited to go to Beijing to compete, but ends up leaving the city again as a hero after saving Chairman Mao from drowning.</p>
			<p>After returning to his home, finds Jenny, his old childhood sweetheart and is invited by her to speak at an anti-war demonstration. The most he could say is "I need to pee." (He always used to say it when he is pressed), throws his medal, reaching a government official and goes to jail.</p>
			<p>It is condemned to embark on a test spacecraft, a project of NASA, along with an astronaut and an orangutan. After a crash the spacecraft lands in New Guinea, where they spend several years living next to a cannibal tribe. The leader of the tribe teaches chess to Forrest, who soon learns and demonstrates once again his unusual skills of reasoning and strategy.</p>
			<p>These are just some of the adventures of a lovely young man who has conquered the world through his innocence.</p>
			<p>Forest Gump is simply an amazing personage. Your courage is admirable, risking his own lives for others, his determination, both in to find the love of his life Jenny, how not to lead a monotonous life, his caliber: dividing his profits with Bubba's family, even after his death; his wit: seeing that the thing that kept him alive, was never let the leader of the cannibals win a chess match.</p>
			<p>He is also the personage of the contrast: While he was not aware (perhaps not intentionally) some rules of etiquette and decency, he had an admirable moral nature and immaculate. He could live in a world parallel to ours within it, in its own reality so vivid and concrete.</p> 
			<p>With his simplicity and unique way to see things, where a visit to the president and to be a national hero were trivial matters, and to play the harmonica in a filthy bar or to fight wearing a donkey costume and be acclaimed for it, was something fantastic, Forrest surprised everyone around.</p>
			<p>The author divinely uses casual language, which fits perfectly to the context, making the reading easy and enjoyable, but makes some exaggeration, as the rocket ride. These adventures are heading to the fiction, while is the proximity to the reality that valorizes the book's content.</p>
			<p>The story of this man stirs our imagination, entertains with a simple and sincere humor, makes us reflect about our limitations, and proves that they are barriers that we can transpose and that some of them are created by ourselves.</p>
