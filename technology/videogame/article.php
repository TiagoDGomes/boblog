  <p>The history of video games begins in 1958, when Willy Higinbotham (physical of Brookhaven National Laboratories in New York state) created something very interesting during your free time: a tennis game demo that worked on an oscilloscope.
    <p>
      <p class="exc">It was common at that time, the public to visit the lab's facilities to check it out. And to the visit does not to become boring, Willy has created a very simple game of tennis, which was processed by an analog computer and displayed on an oscilloscope. It was a great success and the public visiting the lab was attracted by this fun. Later, the fun was named "Tennis Programming".

      </div>
      <p>Four years later, in 1961, programmers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) developed the Spacewar, a game that used to ship actual physical concepts such as acceleration and gravity, to encourage visitors to enter the world of computing. Ran on a DEC PDP-1 computer to 4 KB of memory, punch cards, monitor, 18-bit processor and a light pen.
      </p>
      <p class="exc">The game was a success and all researchers of the institute used to go to the department where he was the PDP-1 just to try the game.
      </p>     <h3>1972 - The first console: Odyssey 100</h3>
      <p>
In 1966, Ralph Baer patented the idea we now know as a video games: a machine that ran games through the TV. The prototype, which was called the "Brown Box" was shown for some companies, but the pioneering Magnavox took place, releasing the first console in history: the Odyssey 100.
      </p>
      <p class="exc">The Odyssey 100 was created in 1972 and its launch had only two games: Tennis and Hockey. Because of the low processing power of the game, users were required to put plastic cards on the TV screen to simulate the playing field.

      </div>
      <p>In 1972 he created the first arcade game history, based on Spacewar! and in 1972 founded one of the best-known companies in the world of video games: <strong>Atari</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="exc">The company started with the classic Pong and this game has a great importance for the history of the game, simply because it was the first profitable play of history, which began an industry that moves billions.
      </p>   <h3>1977 - The classic age of video games: the Atari 2600</h3>
      <p>During the existence of the Atari there were many other companies in the emerging field of video games, but nothing compared to the reign of Atari.
      </p>
      <p class="exc">Then in 1976, that Warner Communications, interested for this hot market, buys Atari, and in 1977 launches what was the big "boom" of the market for video games: the Atari Video Computer System, which was soon after renamed <strong>Atari 2600</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="exc">Classics such as Enduro, Pitfall, River Raid and Space Invaders were striking, for children and adults who lived in the early '80s.

      </div>     <h3>1978 - A new generation of the Odyssey</h3>
      <p>With the success of the Atari 2600, Magnavox decided to launch a new generation of console, called <strong>Odyssey<sup>2</sup></strong> and its great feature was built-in keyboard on the console.

        </span>
      </div>
      <p class="exc">The <strong>Odyssey<sup>2</sup></strong> didn't have more power processing than the 2600. Therefore, the images were pretty square. Still, because of an advertising appeal about the quality of the produced titles, got the public's sympathy.
      </p>
<h3>1980 - A real competitor for the Atari, the Intellivision</h3>

      <p>   Several companies have tried, but only to Mattel, one of the largest U.S. toy companies, threatened the reign of the Atari, releasing <strong>Intellivision</strong> (Intelligent Television)
      </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      <p>The Intellivision's graphics were much better than 2600's, but what mattered to people was the games, which was equivalent to those available for the Atari 2600.
      </p>
      <p class="exc"> Sold over 3 million consoles in the U.S. alone, and was just discontinued for the same reason that the Odyssey: the crash of 1984.
      </p>  <h3>1984-85 - The big crash and Nintendo enter on American soil</h3>
      <p class="exc">The popularization do Atari 2600's brought a lot of of low quality games. With this, users lost interest in this sector and many companies began to close
      </p>
      <p>Across the world, the Japanese company Nintendo releases the Nintendo Famicom (Family Computer). As the company failed to deal with Atari to sell your console in the U.S., she decided to enter the U.S. market alone in 1985 in his game, with the name of <strong>Nintendo Entertainment System</strong>, the popular <strong>NES</strong>, rebuilded the video game industry and is dominated by the Japanese.

      </p>
      <p class="exc"> The NES games became epic, a fact marked by exclusive contracts with major softhouses that  created games just for the NES. The Nintendo has created its classic franchise games like Super Mario Bros and The Legend Of Zelda.

        <p>In 1984, SEGA, a giant in the arcade's world, launches the Mark III that would be later the basis of its console, the <strong>Master System</strong>. It was a game that was coming to compete with the NES, with modern look, sound produced by a powerfull chip and better graphics. SEGA could exceed the success of Nintendo, but it did not hapened.
        </p>
	    <p class="exc">
Even having the hardware better than the competitor, Sega did not have quality games, used to invest in bad games and to renounce good releases. Then there was the problem of big softhouses have made a contract with Nintendo to produce games only for the NES, Master System, having only the games produced by Sega.
      </p>
      <p class="exc"> The SEGA  brought to Master System a very interesting accessory: the 3D glasses. With this glasses, the gamer could to realize the game's depth, thanks to two LCD displays sequentially flashing, but it was unconfortable.

      </p>  <h3>1990 - Turning the thing around: Sega released the Mega Drive / Genesis</h3>
      <p>Aware that was not match your Master System to compete with NES, SEGA launched in 1990 its 16-bit console, the <strong>Mega Drive</strong> (known in the U.S. was the <strong>Genesis</strong>).
      </p>
      <p> The graphics power of Mega Drive was amazing, futuristic design. And now with the support of weight, because the console games had productions of the great softhousesas Sunsoft, Capcom, Electronic Arts and Hudson, and of course, Sega's own games, to this console that launched the company's mascot: Sonic

      </div>
      <p class="exc">Later, Sega released a device that could make the console run games recorded on CD. Is the begin of SEGA CD, an accessory that broadened the graphic and sound capabilities, with a powerful processor and the ability to run full motion videos. Nevertheless, the games created for the Sega CD did not use all the processing on the enhancement, making the device a commercial flop.
      </p>   <h3>1990 - Time to follow the market: Nintendo released its successor</h3>
      <p>Aware that its 8-bit console wouldn't hold so much longer in the market, Nintendo went back and launched the successor to the NES. Entered the market the Super Famicom, but in the western world became known as Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES).
      </p>

      <p class="exc"> The console despite having less processing power than Mega Drive, became a fever betwen consuming public, bringing a range of the best games in the history.</p><p>

        </span>
      </div>
      <p>There is a very curious story about the Super Nintendo. The console has a lot of peripheral devices, but what intrigued was the announcement of the SNES CD, a prototype that enabled games to run on CD, as was the SEGA CD. The partnership to create this accessory was made with Sony, but the contract was broken with Nintendo, and Sony launches its own console, based on the device that would be the Super Nintendo named Playstation. Ironically or not, Nintendo lost market leadership invideo games for Sony, but that's another story ...
      </p>    <h3>    </h3>
      <p> We follow the history of video games in the 40 years of this product. We saw the main islands of the market and its characteristics. Continuing the success story we have the Sony Playstation, the decay of the SEGA consoles and the rise of Microsoft in the gaming world. Until next time.
